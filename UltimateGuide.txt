<h4>Why, then, ‘tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so’…. 
Act 2 Scene 2 Hamlet.</h4>

<p>Welcome to the Hitchhiker’s Guide thru Planet Earth’s “History”. From the Author who brought 
you classics such as: Surviving the Age Old Question: ‘What if a Planet was a Fart: Venus… aka the Love Planet’, 
Mars, Let me see you Blush, and finally the galactic bestseller, Pluto you in or nah? However unlike those Planetary 
Sci-Fi thrillers, this is a historical ‘guide’ thru a Planet’s history….. I should probably mention at this point that 
I am using the word guide very loosely. Using this ‘guide’ as anything other than for historical purposes, say like a 
Survivalist guide is tantamount to saying Grizzly Bears (big dog-like beast who cannot be reason with) to Teddy Bears 
(stuff dog-like beast very reasonable and understanding toys) are cousins. They are not and this is not similar to a 
survivalist guide. Truth be told calling this a Historical Guide is walking a very fine line. But without further ado, 
let us walk that fine line…. or lines. Planet Earth’s History is like a torn Christmas sweater with many loose threads, 
you want to bury it at the bottom of sweater drawer, but every time you open it the draw u see a single thread that leads 
to something horrific in nature....</p>

<p>Before we get to unknitting this sweater we have some time scale terms that need to be defined:</p>

<p>A "Eon" is a scale that measures years by ½ a billion. Because the weight of history is a real thing and just thinking of ½ billion years
can put you in a coma. Certain phrase are acceptable when describing this time period such as ‘Way back when’, and ‘Once upon a time’.<p> 

<p>An "Era" measure years by 100 million years. The only acceptable phrase for this period is "A long long time ago".</p>

<p>An "Epoch" measures years by 10 million years. Its phrase for this time period, you guessed it, "A long time ago".</p>

<p>Finally the last measurement is "Age" which is about 1 million years. The logical phrase for this period is "Ages Ago".</p>

<p>I'm sure to some the phrases seem to be something out of a nursey rhyme, well you guessed it, those nursery rhymes has some truth to it...
With our time scale measurement terms out the way, we can move forward with the fabled Chaotion Eon....</p>

<h4>By all that is holy who made this god-forsaken Christmas Sweater?!?</h4>

<p>Let’s start with the longest thread on this planet’s Ugly Christmas sweater. You can't even consider it a thread more like an idea for the perfect 
ugly sweater. You see because our technology is limited and nobody alive during this time wrote about this period we are left with a theory on the 
events that took place before the actual formation of this planet. Way back when, before the Earth had even form, the Milky Way was cooking up a meal 
for the Universe that would be different in spices but similar in texture. Most of the elements this side of the universe was in this so-called 
"solar system pressure cooker", from the all to common "hydrogen"(nothing than just one proton, one electron and no neutrons, child's play, right?) 
to the rotten egg element or "methane". This whole phase is known as the "Chaotian Eon". Properly name so too, for their was chasos brewing within 
that pressure cooker. Two eras lived wthin this Chaotian Eon, they are known as the Ecochatian and Neochaotian era.</p>
